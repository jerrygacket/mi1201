5DPO Component Library.

This library includes a serial communication component (TSdpoSerial), an IEEE1394 camera component (TSdpoVideo1394), an UVC video driver component (TSdpoVideo4L2) and a Gtk form component (TSdpoFastForm).
TSdpoSerial allows asynchronous communication using a serial port based on Synaser. Works in Linux and Windows.
TSdpoVideo4L2 allows the control of UVC compliant USB cameras, tested with Logitech Quickcam Orbit/Sphere AF, Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000, Logitech Quickcam Ultra Vision and Acer CrystalEye webcam (Acer Aspire One). For more information go to http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/. Works only in Linux.
TSdpoFastForm creates a Gtk window that is useful for fast painting of images (like the ones from the camera) and allows full control of the paint action, useful for real-time image processing. Works only in Linux.
TSdpoJoystick enables the access to a joystick's axis and buttons. Works in Windows and Linux.

All programs are compiled with Free Pascal 2.0.4+ (http://www.freepascal.org)
